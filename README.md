# Polynomial Fit and Plot
This is a python script that performs polynomial fits and plots the results. This code is a data analysis script in python using the libraries numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn and matplotlib.

## Input Data
The input data is a CSV file named Bx_Bc_data.dat_2.40_-4.95_5.80. It contains data for columns a, b, c, Z, ex_calc, ec_calc, exc_calc, ex_exact, ec_exact, exc_exact, ex_lda, ec_lda, and exc_lda.

## Method
The script starts by importing the necessary libraries. The data is then loaded into a pandas dataframe using the read_csv method. The data is read from a file named 'Bx_Bc_data.dat_2.40_-4.95_5.80', with a specified delimiter and with the 'python' engine. The columns in the data are then named.

Next, the script performs some calculations on the data and creates new columns. Three new columns are created with the difference between two energy values, and another two columns with the absolute value of the difference between two energy values divided by Z, where Z is a column in the data. The value of Z is also raised to the power of -1/3 and stored in a new column.

The script then fits a 2nd degree polynomial regression to three sets of data points using the np.polyfit method and stores the polynomial coefficients in separate variables (coeffs6, coeffs7, coeffs8). The resulting polynomials are stored in variables p6, p7, p8.

Next, the script uses the polynomials to make predictions and calculates the R-squared values using the r2_score method. The R-squared values are stored in variables r1squared, r2squared, and r3squared.

Finally, the script plots the original data points and the fitted polynomials. The polynomials are smoothed using the UnivariateSpline method and are plotted on the same graph with different colors and labels. The graph is labeled with the x and y axis labels, and the R-squared values are annotated on the plot.

# Introduction
This code calculates the derivative of the function f_scan_gsic_alpha_e2 with respect to alpha using the sympy library. The code also plots the derivative of the function.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the following libraries:

math
matplotlib.pyplot
numpy
sympy
## Functions
The code contains two functions:

* g2_e(alpha, n, e): Returns the value of (alpha^n) * e^(-e * alpha).
* f_scan_gsic_alpha_e2(a, b, c, d, alpha): Returns the value of the function a * g2_e(alpha, 2.0, 2.0) + b * g2_e(alpha, 3.0, 2.0) + c * g2_e(alpha, 4.0, 2.0) + d * g2_e(alpha, 5.0, 2.0).
## Execution
The code calculates the derivative of f_scan_gsic_alpha_e2 using the sympy library and stores it in the variable scaling_fu_e2. The value of the derivative is evaluated over a range of values of alpha using the numpy library and stored in the f_e2 variable. Finally, the plot of the derivative is generated using the matplotlib.pyplot library.

## Conclusion
This code provides an example of how to calculate the derivative of a function and plot it using the sympy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries in Python.
